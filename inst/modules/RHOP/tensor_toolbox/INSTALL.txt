To install the Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB:

1. Unpack the compressed file. In a linux environment, for example, this can
   be done from the command line via:

     unzip tensor_toolbox_2.6.zip

   *or*

     gunzip -c tensor_toolbox_2.6.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   This should create a directory named *tensor_toolbox_2.6*.

2. Rename the root directory from *tensor_toolbox_2.6* 
   to *tensor_toolbox*.

3. Start MATLAB.

4. Within MATLAB, cd to the *tensor_toolbox* directory and execute the
   following commands:

     addpath(pwd) %<-- Add the tensor toolbox to the MATLAB path
     cd met; addpath(pwd) %<-- [OPTIONAL] Also add the met directory
     savepath %<-- Save for future MATLAB sessions

5. For help, type

     help tensor_toolbox

   To see the documentation, go to the help home screen. 
   Click "Supplemental Software" in the lower left. 
   Choose "Tensor Toolbox" and browse the pages.

   For help on MET, be sure that the met directory is on your path and 
   then get a directory listing with explanation by typing

     help met
