\usage{
plot_signals(signals, sample_rate = 1, col = 1, space = 0.995,
  space_mode = "quantile", start_time = 0, duration = NULL,
  compress = TRUE, channel_names = NULL, ylab = "Channel",
  time_shift = 0, lwd = 0.5, cex = 2, new_plot = T,
  plot = "base", xlim = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{signals}{signals to plot, with each row one signal}

\item{sample_rate}{sample rate}

\item{col}{Color, either length of 1 or number of signals. Can be numeric or color name}

\item{space}{space between to signals. If \code{space_mode='quantile'}, then
space is determined by quantile of signal (0 - 1). If \code{space_mode='absoute'}, then
space will be as is.}

\item{start_time}{Time in seconds at which time point the signal should be drawn}

\item{duration}{length of 1. Time in seconds the duration of time to be drawn.
Default is NULL (Total time span)}

\item{compress}{FALSE means no compression for signals, TRUE is auto-detection,
2, 3, 4,... means compress signals by x and then plot. (usually compress signal to save time)}

\item{channel_names}{Names for each signals. Will be Y tick labels}

\item{ylab}{Y axis label}

\item{plot, xlim, space_mode, time_shift, lwd, cex, new_plot}{Depricated.}

\item{...}{pass to matplot}
